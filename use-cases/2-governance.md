# Community Governance

**Transparent, contribution-based community ownership and decision-making**

> "As a Community Manager I want to create and grow a Community. Ownership should lie with the Community contributors and more active and trusted members should be able to govern transparently."

> "As a passive member of a Community I want to delegate (liquid vote) trust to contributors to support them growing the Community."

## Core Governance Principles

TopLocs implements **decentralized governance** where:
- **Community Contributors** have more influence than passive members
- **Trust is transparent** and can be tracked through the platform
- **Liquid voting** allows members to delegate decision-making power
- **Ownership evolves** with community contributions over time

## User Scenarios

### Community Manager
As a **Community Manager**, I want to:
- **Create Communities**: Start new interest-based communities with clear governance rules
- **Grow Membership**: Attract and onboard new members through transparent processes
- **Facilitate Decisions**: Help the community make collective decisions about direction and rules
- **Distribute Authority**: Gradually transfer governance power to active, trusted contributors
- **Maintain Transparency**: Ensure all governance actions are visible and accountable

### Active Contributor
As an **Active Contributor**, I want to:
- **Earn Trust**: Build reputation through consistent, valuable contributions
- **Participate in Governance**: Vote on community decisions and policy changes
- **Delegate Responsibilities**: Take on specific roles (event organization, content moderation, etc.)
- **Influence Direction**: Shape the community's future based on my expertise and commitment
- **Mentor Others**: Help new members understand and participate in governance

### Passive Member
As a **Passive Member**, I want to:
- **Delegate Trust**: Support active contributors I trust to make decisions on my behalf
- **Stay Informed**: Receive updates about important community decisions without active participation
- **Liquid Democracy**: Change my delegation when I disagree with representatives
- **Selective Participation**: Engage directly only on issues I care deeply about
- **Trust Transparency**: See how my delegated trust is being used

## Governance Mechanisms

### Trust Network
- **Profile-to-Profile Trust**: Members can express trust in other members
- **Topic-Specific Trust**: Trust can be scoped to specific areas of expertise
- **Trust Delegation**: Liquid democracy where trust can be delegated transitively
- **Trust Transparency**: All trust relationships are visible to community members

### Decision-Making Process
1. **Proposal Creation**: Any member can create governance proposals
2. **Discussion Period**: Open discussion and proposal refinement
3. **Voting Phase**: Direct voting or delegated voting through trust network
4. **Implementation**: Transparent execution of approved decisions
5. **Review**: Regular assessment of governance effectiveness

### Contribution Recognition
- **Activity Tracking**: Contributions are recorded and weighted
- **Reputation Building**: Long-term participation increases governance influence
- **Skill Recognition**: Expertise in specific areas grants domain-specific authority
- **Succession Planning**: Gradual transition of authority to proven contributors

## Technical Implementation

### Trust Relations
Building on TopLocs' universal relation system:
```
Profile x Profile x Interest: (n:m:l) Gov:Trust
```
- **Bidirectional Trust**: Members can trust and be trusted by others
- **Weighted Trust**: Trust levels can vary based on contribution and time
- **Scoped Trust**: Trust can be specific to interests or governance areas

### Governance Plugins
- **Voting Plugin**: Implement various voting mechanisms (direct, delegated, ranked choice)
- **Proposal Plugin**: Create, discuss, and track governance proposals
- **Reputation Plugin**: Track and display member contributions and trust levels
- **Transparency Plugin**: Audit trail of all governance actions and decisions
